This Quarto project is for my "Oops I am a Manager - On Minimal Viable **Process**"
 for Posit Conf 2024.

It makes the case for zooming out on your process and being intentional with experimenting, in small increments, with the process your team uses to operate.

I will add a link to the video when it becomes available in a few weeks.

This is the second in the series, in 2023 I did a talk on doing better 1-on-1 meetings with your team, colleagues and boss.
