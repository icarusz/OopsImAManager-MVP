## Who am I {background-image="/images/backgrounds/OopsLineupBackground.png"}
### (and why "Oops" ?) 
<br>

- Many early leadership opportunities are "battlefield promotions" 

- Leadership roles often "emerge" rather than being planned

- Very few organizations have good (or any?) leadership development

HOW I GOT HERE

HERE? CURRENT TITLE "HEAD OF ENGINEERING OPEN SOURCE"
supporting Shiny,Quarto and mlverse teams

- BELL LABS 25 YEARS AGO ONE JOB OUT OF MY CS/PYSCH degree

MANY LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES ARE ACCIDENTAL OR BACKED INTO

OPPORTUNITY EMERGE

THIS TALK IS A LITTLE HELP FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE ON THE OOPS 

NOT SO SECRET MISSION IS TO ENCOURAGE EXPLORATION of TECHNICAL MANAMANGENT FOR THOSE WITH INTEREST

## Why Minimal Viable Process?!?

## The Human Brain 
### (and core needs)
<br>
  Prefontal Cortex - rationality, logic, â€“ deep complex work
  
  Amygdala - analyzing the environment and looking for danger

<br>

  - Group meetings are complex environments and if the person is under stress
  (struggling with a deadline) the Amagdala can kick into gear
  
  - Some discussions which are a minefield in a group setting can be rationally worked through 1-on-1  

  - Between a lead and a team member OR between two team members

::: {.notes}
  TO UNDERSTAND WHY 1on1s ARE IMPORTANT FOR TEAM HEALTH
  
  PERHAPS YOU HAVE BEEN WITNESS TO A MEETING FREAK OUT - IF NOT YET YOU WILL BE

  PREFRONTAL CORTEX - LOGIC and RATIONALITY
  
  AMYGDALA - ANYLZE ENVIRONMENTS LOOKING FOR DANGER
  
  GROUP MEETINGS ARE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS!!!

  CORE NEEDS 
  
    Belonging
  
    Equality and Fairness 
  
    Progress
  
    Choice 
    
  TAKE TOPICS THAT TOUCH ON CORE NEEDS OUT OF THE GROUP SESSION AND INTO 1om1s

## 1-on-1s are Essential {background-image="/images/backgrounds/Oops1in1AllTypesBackground.png"}
<br>
Better 1-on-1s -> Increased Trust -> Stonger Teams

Consider three important flavors (with three associated practices)


::: {.notes}

THREE TYPES, THREE TACTICS

TACTICS ARE SIMPLE

:::

## Team Lead and Team Member {background-image="/images/backgrounds/OopsTeamLeadBackground.png"}
### <b>GOALS</b>
<br> 

- Build trust

- Establish goals (personal and team)

- Give feedback *

::: {.notes}

TRUST IS BUILT ON GOOD 1-on-1s - BEDROCK

GOALS - TEAM VALUE

GOALS - PERSONAL - CAREER GROWTH

FEEDBACK - HARD CONVERSATIONS CAN BUILD TRUST

FEEDBACK - CRAP SANDWHICH

RATHER - DIRECT SPECIFIC OBERSVATIONS AND FOCUS ON QUESTIONS

GAUGE REACTIONS AND ADJUST - ITERATE

PRO TIP: 
AVOID ALOT OF PROJ STATUS - WILL FILL TIME AND DISTRACTS FROM DEEPER GOALS
:::

## {background-image="/images/backgrounds/Oops1in1QuestionsBackground.png"}

::: {.notes}

LANGUAGE SHOULD BE ABOUT JOINT EXPLORATION

POWERFUL QUESTIONS LEADING TO IMPORTANT _2 PERSON DISCUSSIONS_

SNEAKY TROUBLES - DISCOVER TROUBLES EARLY

PRO TIP:  Keep conversations mostly constructive (without avoiding challenging feedback)

<tactic-details> - Take list from previous slide 

<tactic-details> - Set an alarm _5 minutes_ before every 1-on-1

<tactic-details> - Note 3 relevant topics

<br>

<tactic-details> *Bonus points*: At the end of each 1-on-1 note the date and topics you meaningfully covered

:::

::: {.notes}
TACTICS are TRIVIALLY EASY

BUT ACTUALLY DO THEM results CAN BE PROFOUND

BUILD AS HABITS SO THEY ARE AUTOMATIC AND SUSTAINED

ITS TALKING TO ANOTHER HUMAN -- HOW HARD CAN IT BE?
:::

## Team Lead and Team Memeber {background-image="/images/backgrounds/OopsTeamLeadBackground.png"}
### <b>Matrix Org?</b>

Data teams are often matrixed orgs (along with QA)

- Spend extra time being supportive and actively listening

- Ask what support or resources they need 

- Ensure they have a clear uderstanding of success 

- Have 1-on-1s with their embedded team lead

::: {.notes}
MATRIX ORG JUST MEANS MANAGEMENT CHAIN DIFFERENT FROM TEAM LEADERSHIP

MORE TIME ON SUPPORTING AND OFFERING HELP

DEFINING SUCCESS CAN BE HARDER

HAVE 1on1 WITH THEIR EMBEDDED TEAM LEAD
:::

## You and Your Boss {background-image="/images/backgrounds/OopsBossBackground.png"}
### GOALS
<br>

- Deep understanding of organizational goals from _their_ perspective

- Cover sticky challenges and avoid "meeting surprises"

- Be explicit about what you are asking for 

::: {.notes}

MORE PREP FOR YOUR BOSS 1-on-1 (ESPICALLY AT HIGHER LEVELS)

THE HIGHER UP - MORE SCOPE - LIVE IN MESSIER WORLDS

WHY MANAGERS OFTEN SEEM CLUELESS

AVOID MEETING SURPRISES

BE EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR - INFORM, ADVICE, ACTION

PRO TIP: I INTEND TO LANGUAGE

SIMPLE ROLLING SHARED DOC

GOOGLEDOCS WORK GREAT - AGAIN SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL

DATE - TOPICS - TAKEWAYS/ACTION ITEMS

HISTORY HELPS YOUR BOSS WITH CONTEXT

LETS YOU FOLLOW UP ON WHAT YOU NEED FROM THEM

PRO TIP: TARGET LESS THAN THREE ACTION/ITEMS
DATES IN THE FUTURE ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR

:::

## You and your Peers {background-image="/images/backgrounds/OopsPeerBackground.png"}
### GOALS

<br>

- Establish shared landscape

- Focused discussions on shared challenges and opportunities 

- Review positive and negative patterns 

::: {.notes}

MORE INFO SHARING THAN OTHERS 

GAPS BETWEEN TEAMS AND TEAM MEMBERS ARE HUGE SOURCE OF WASTE AND COFLICT - HELP FILL THEM IN

SHARED MINI RETRO

ALTHOUGH A BIT OF VENTING CAN BE CATHARTIC AVOID TOO MUCH

SCHEDULED PAIRING CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL

PRO TIP: SIMPLE OFFERS OF HELP BUILD TRUST - START SMALL

<tactic-details> Accumulate gradually, seasonally prune

BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHO YOU MEET WITH AND HOW OFTEN

MOST ORGANIZATIONS LOSE CRITICAL STUFF INTO CRACKS - SEAL THEM WITH PEER 1on1s

IF YOU DRAW - BET AT LEAST ONE MISSING 1on1 STARES BACK AT YOU

EVEN QUARTERLY CAN BE SURPRISINGLY HELPFUL

PRO TIP: AVOID ONLY HAVING WITH FAVORITES - CAN LEAD TO CLIQUES

:::

## Aligning all the sneetches 
### MAY DROP

TRUST AND ALGINMENT

(pyramid on the three layers and aligning - goals on one side arrow pyramid on the other)

Leveraging the safety and specificity a 1-on-1 can provide - to help maintain autonomy but ensure alignment

## Conclusion

### A plug for exploring technical management 
<br>

- Do you feel joy when someone you helped or your team succeeds 

- Does poorly organized or wasteful work drives you crazy 

<br>

- Leaders and managers are multipliers on those they serve

- Opportunities abound and are ever changing

- Improving 1-on-1s is a low risk way to explore

::: notes

TEAM SUCCESS BRINGS YOU JOY? WASTED WORK DRIVE YOU CRAZY?

TECHNICAL LEADERSHIP MIGHT BE THE WAY

HUGE NEED CUZ SO MANY TECHNICAL FOLK AVOID - DIFFERENT THAN WHAT GOT THEM THERE

RIGHT FOR ME?

I FEEL MORE PRIDE FOR THE MANY SUPER TALENTED FOLKS
I HAVE HELPED ON THEIR LEADERSHIP JOURNEY THEN ANYTHING I HAVE PERSONALLY DELIEVED

TIMECHECK - save a minute - WORRIED ABOUT NO WAY BACK?

CHRIS ALTERNATED - IC vs MANAGEMENT AND BOTH WERE STRENGTHENED

HELPING ROBIN LEVEL UP - THERE IS A RUBICON - MNGR of MNGRs

## Said another way...  {.poem}
<br>

In the land of the office, where meetings reside,

Let's talk about 1-on-1s, oh, they can't be denied!

For they're more than just chatter, more than just talk,

They're the *path to success*, not a casual walk.

<br>

So listen up closely, for tactics are here,

To make all your 1-on-1s something quite dear.

::: notes

IF YOU LOVE DR SEUSS 1/2 as MUCH AS I HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BRING IT ALL HOME

IF NOT I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR MY INDULGNENCE

:::

## {.poem}
<br><br>

Tactic One, my friend, is a tip quite divine,

*Rotate different topics*, let variety shine!

Don't dwell on status, oh no, not too long,

For a mix of discussions will make your bond strong.

## {.poem}

<br> <br>

Tactic Two, you see, is a gem quite rare,

Always *prepare notes*, show that you care!

Keep a shared running set, for both you and for me,

So when we look back, our progress we'll see.

## {.poem}
<br><br> 

Tactic Three, ah yes, is the key to the door,

*Draw out relationships*, you'll find so much more.

Schedule frequency, and length, oh so wisely,

For these are the moments that matter precisely.

## {.poem}

<br>

So there you have it, tactics one, two, and three,

Apply them with care, and then you will see.

<br>

*Though they may seem simple, don't let that confound,*

For their impact on success is truly profound.

<br>

As your 1-on-1s flourish, like a well-tended tree,

together, oh together, *how great we'll all be!*
